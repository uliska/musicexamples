% Lowlevel printing commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The following commands are used to print music examples
% without keeping track of them or numbering them.
% While it is perfectly possible to directly include image files
% instead, it is advisable to use them as a consistent interface
%
% The commands check if the given file name points to a useable image.
% If it doesn't they print a message box instead,
% and they color the entry in the \listofmusicxamples .
%
% First the image file check
